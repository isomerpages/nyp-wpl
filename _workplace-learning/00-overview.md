## **Overview of Workplace Learning**


In the manpower-lean environment that most businesses operate in today, making full use of learning opportunities at work has become a business imperative in order to minimise downtime in operations.

Enterprises committed to supporting and developing their staff to grow into the job, excel on-the-job, and move across or up the organisation ladder will be more successful at retaining talent. This is especially critical for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), as they face more challenges in terms of recruitment, training and retention.



Learning happens all the time. We don't go into a course thinking: "For the next six hours I’m going to learn. After that I’m going to stop."

You might think that as an adult, your learning days are over. Wrong! We learn every day, especially at work. We learn how to do our job, how to communicate with people, new tips and tricks, and sometimes we even learn how to learn.

To prepare Singapore for the future, the national SkillsFuture initiative highlights the importance of skills mastery. What better way of developing our skills than by making sure we learn and perform effectively at work?



When we think of learning, most of us think about schools and universities, or of career training with a focus on job requirements and professional advancement being the key impetus. Learning is even seen by some companies as a costly disruption to workplace productivity.

But did you know that learning which happens through work and for work is way more effective than learning outside of work? Multiple studies over the past few years have shown that the workplace can be a really effective, if not the most effective, place to learn.
