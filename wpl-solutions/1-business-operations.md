### Food waste is one of the biggest waste streams in Singapore and the amount of food waste generated has grown by around 40% over the last 10 years. 763 million kg of food waste was generated in 2018 – that’s the weight of more than 54,000 double decker buses.

#### Why is this a problem? 

Food waste makes up about half of the average 1.5kg of waste disposed of by each household in Singapore daily. Of which, more than half of household food waste can be prevented, with rice, noodles and bread being the most commonly wasted food items.
