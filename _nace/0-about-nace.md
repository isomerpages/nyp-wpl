The **National Centre of Excellence for Workplace Learning (NACE)** aims to help establishments level-up workplace learning and development capability. Employees are better able to apply deep skills while organisations are better able to respond to a rapidly-changing environment.

We can help, not only to systematically put in place training systems and certifications, according to companiesâ€™ needs, but also help customise the training so that these gains will be long left within your organisation.

NACE draws on the expertise of international institutions - the Swiss Federal Institute for Vocational Education and Training (SFIVET), the German Chamber of Industry & Commerce (IHK Akademie) and the Singaporean-German Chamber of Industry and Commerce (SGC).
