### What is Skills Framework?

The Skills Framework is an integral component of the Industry Transformation Maps and it is co-created by Employers, Industry Associations, Education Institutions, Unions and Government for the Singapore workforce. The Skills Framework provides key information on sector, career pathways, occupations/job roles, as well as existing and emerging skills required for the occupations/job roles. It also provides a list of training programmes for skills upgrading and mastery.

The Skills Framework aims to create a common skills language for individuals, employers and training providers. This further helps to facilitate skills recognition and support the design of training programmes for skills and career development. The Skills Framework is also developed with the objectives to build deep skills for a lean workforce, enhance business competitiveness and support employment and employability.
