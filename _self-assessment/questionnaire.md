The purpose of this organisational self-assessment is to provide companies and organisations with a general sensing of the strength of their approach and implementation efforts in workplace learning. 

The questions are specifically designed and focused on evaluating workplace learning efforts across the 6 core component on the National Workplace Learning Framework, namely Strategy, Leadership, Planning, Training Needs Analysis, Environment and Implementation & Processes.

It would be useful for all responders to the assessment to possess a relatively good understanding of learning and development plans and activities within the organisation, in order to generate an accurate and meaningful evaluation. 

The assessment will take you approximately 20 minutes to complete.
