#### *Sometimes it is difficult to create learning sessions at the workplace  that suits all the staff.* 


Providing a supportive learning environment includes: 

- Providing flexible learning opportunities to cater to diverse staff needs based on their demographics, state of health and changing lifestyle
- Supporting learning at work by providing a conducive environment for learning and feedback on learning and performance 
- Ensuring appropriate professional development opportunities are available for a diversity of staff profiles; based on age, gender, education levels, language abilities, etc
