# **My staff does not seem to have the right skills to do their job well.**

#### *I want to improve my operations through helping my staff improve their current skills, but I don’t know what are the core skills they are lacking in and I should train them in? What can I do?* 

Effective manpower development requires a clear understanding of skills gaps. This will ensure that limited training budget gets allocated to skills interventions that can close actual skills gaps, hence boosting staff morale, engagement and performance on the job.

Conducting a Training Needs Analysis include:

- Clarifying the current and future performance requirements for roles in the company
- Determining the skills gaps in staff’s current knowledge, skills and attitude (KSA)
- Determining  the needs and requirements for workplace learning
- Determining the costs and benefits of workplace learning
- Establishing a total company training plan
