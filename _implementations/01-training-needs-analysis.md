#### *I want to improve my operations through helping my staff improve their current skills, but I don’t know what are the key skills they need. What can I do?* 

Effective manpower development requires a clear understanding of skills gaps and learning solutions. 
Appropriate resources need to be provided for learning solutions that can close actual skills gaps, hence boosting staff morale and engagement, and leading to improvements in job performance over time. 

Conducting a Training Needs Analysis include:

- Clarifying the current and future performance requirements for roles in the organisation
- Determining the skills gaps in staff’s current knowledge, skills and attitude (KSA)
- Determining  the needs and requirements for workplace learning
- Determining the costs and benefits of workplace learning
- Establishing a total company training plan (TCTP)
