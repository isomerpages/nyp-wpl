# **I think my staff can perform better with the right skills.**

#### *I want to improve my operations through helping my staff improve their current skills, but I donâ€™t know what are the core skills they are lacking in and I should train them in? What can I do?* 

Effective training and development of staff depends on knowing what is required for staff capability development. 

As most organisations may have limited budgets and time for training, there is a strong need to ensure that the training provided helps close the real skills gaps and help people perform to their full potential. Organisations will then see a positive change in performance, a positive return on investment in training and staff will feel more equipped to do their job well.
