### **STRATEGY**
***Strategic Considerations for Competency Development***

Embarking on new directions for the growth and development of the organisation can impact the overall plan for competency development for current and future human resource needs.

The organisation is aware of the competencies it needs in order to achieve its goals and be successful. 
The essential competencies for the organisation are identified and validated and measures are defined.
