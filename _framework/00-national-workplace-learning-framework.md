### **LEADERSHIP**
***Leadership Practices that Foster a Learning Culture***

Leaders can foster a learning culture within the organisation by promoting learning as a key value in the organisation. They can be good role-models for learning by upgrading their own skills and knowledge continuously and sharing their knowledge and skills through coaching and mentoring.

### **Implementation and Processes**
***Implementing Effective Workplace Learning Practices***

While sending staff for external training programmes can be beneficial, it can be a challenge for small businesses to maintain their normal operations. To increase opportunities for learning at the workplace, appropriate learning solutions can be provided that take place at work itself.

### **Training Needs Analysis**
***Considering the Needs, Costs, Benefits and Suitability of Learning Solutions***

Effective manpower development requires a clear understanding of skills gaps and learning solutions. Appropriate resources need to be provided for learning solutions that can close actual skills gaps, hence boosting staff morale and engagement, and leading to improvements in job performance over time.
