# **"Not all my staff like to learnâ€¦ or learns the same way!"**

		
It is often difficult to create learning sessions at the workplace that suits the needs and preferences of all the staff. People tend to have different learning styles and learning preferences. 

There is also a need to ensure that supportive learning spaces can be provided and time for workplace learning to happen can be made available.

#### **Providing a supportive environment that caters to diverse learning needs include:** 

- Providing flexible learning opportunities to cater to diverse staff needs based on their demographics, state of well-being (health) and changing lifestyle
- Supporting learning at work by providing a conducive environment for learning and feedback on learning and performance
- Ensuring appropriate professional development opportunities are available for a diversity of staff profiles; based on age, gender, education levels, language abilities, etc
