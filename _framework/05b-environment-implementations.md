# **"Not all my staff like to learnâ€¦ or learns the same way!"**

		
#### *Sometimes it is difficult to create learning sessions at the workplace that suits the needs and preferences of all the staff. Some staff are not so good in understanding English, some staff like to learn on their own while others like to learn together.. They are different people!* 


Providing a supportive learning environment includes: 

- Providing flexible learning opportunities to cater to diverse staff needs based on their demographics, state of health and changing lifestyle
- Supporting learning at work by providing a conducive environment for learning and feedback on learning and performance 
- Ensuring appropriate professional development opportunities are available for a diversity of staff profiles; based on age, gender, education levels, language abilities, etc
