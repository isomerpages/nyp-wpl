#### *Some supervisors and managers are very good at their job but they do not help the staff learn well through coaching and mentoring them effectively. How can I help my staff learn from the best people I have?* 

Leaders can foster a learning culture within the organisation by promoting learning as a key value in the organisation. They can be good role-models for learning by upgrading their own skills and knowledge continuously and sharing their knowledge and skills through coaching and mentoring.

Leadership policies and practices that promote a learning-friendly culture include:

- Strengthening the skill of managers to coach, mentor and motivate staff to learn
- Supporting staff in their learning and development
- Providing platforms and resources that support learning
- Supporting peer learning at work
- Assessing the impact of learning on staff
