# **"Leaders in my organisation do not promote learning and this does not help foster a learning culture."**

Some leaders are very good at their job but they do not know how to coach staff or promote learning to help the staff be self-driven learners. 

Leaders can foster a learning culture within the organisation by promoting learning as a key value in the organisation. They can be good role-models for learning by upgrading their own skills and knowledge continuously and sharing their knowledge and skills through coaching and mentoring.

#### **Leadership policies and practices that can promote a learning culture include:**

- Strengthening the skill of leaders to coach, mentor and motivate staff to learn
- Acting as positive role models for continuous learning
- Supporting and motivating staff in their learning and development
- Providing opportunities, platforms and resources to support peer learning
