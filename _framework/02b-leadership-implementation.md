# **"Leaders in my organisation do not promote learning and help foster a learning culture."**


Some leaders are very good at their job but they do not know how to coach staff or promote learning to help the staff be self-driven learners. 

<br>
<br>

Leaders can foster a learning culture within the organisation by promoting learning as a key value in the organisation. They can be good role-models for learning by upgrading their own skills and knowledge continuously and sharing their knowledge and skills through coaching and mentoring.


Leadership policies and practices that promote a learning-friendly culture include:

- Strengthening the skill of managers to coach, mentor and motivate staff to learn
- Supporting staff in their learning and development
- Providing platforms and resources that support learning
- Supporting peer learning at work
- Assessing the impact of learning on staff
