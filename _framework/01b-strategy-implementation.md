# **"Our company is embarking on digitalisation and it may make some roles and skills redundant."**
	
We know that new strategies like digitalisation can impact certain jobs. There will be a need to retrain and redeploy staff to other roles and other parts of the company. But where and what?	

Embarking on new directions for the growth and development of the organisation can impact the overall plan for competency development for current and future human resource needs.

**Some strategies for developing new capabilities include:**

- Taking stock of competencies within the organisation for current and future needs
- Identifying appropriate knowledge and skills for competency development in line with the future growth and development of the organisation
- Anchoring competency development as a strategic goal
- Promoting the benefits of workplace learning through various channels and platforms internally
