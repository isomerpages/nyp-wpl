#### *Without a structured workplace learning system aligned to our business needs, our staff learning activities may be insufficient and misdirected, and not aligned to the growth and development needs of our organisation.* 

To harness the benefits of workplace learning, it is critical to plan for staff learning and development with a set roadmap towards targeted capability development that is aligned to current and future business needs. 

Planning for purposeful and systematic workplace learning include:

- Ensuring learning programmes are relevant, current and future oriented
- Establishing a schedule for learning activities
- Tracking learning application at work after formal training interventions
- Working with training vendors to ensure a high quality of training is delivered
- Establishing and maintaining an effective induction programme for new hires in all roles
- Supporting the development of in-house trainers
