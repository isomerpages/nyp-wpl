# **"My staff attends training but it is not always relevant to their work."**
		
Without a structured workplace learning system aligned to business needs, staff learning and development activites may be insufficient and not aligned to the growth and development needs of the organisation.

To harness the benefits of workplace learning, it is critical to plan for staff learning and development with a set roadmap towards targeted capability development that is aligned to current and future business needs.

#### **Planning for workplace learning purposefully and systematically includes:**

- Ensuring learning programmes are relevant, current and future oriented and tracking learning application at work  
- Supporting the development of in-house trainers / coaches / mentors
- Collaborating with training partners to ensure high standards of training delivery 
- Maintaining an effective induction programme for new hires in all roles
