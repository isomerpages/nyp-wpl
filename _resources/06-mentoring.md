#### Mentoring

**Mentoring is a powerful career development and engagement tool.**

It is an effective way of helping people to progress in their careers. It is a collaborative relationship between two people (mentor and mentee) normally not in a supervisor-supervisee relationship. The relationship is based upon openness, mutual trust and respect. 

A mentor helps the mentee explore career issues and guides them to take self-ownership for career development. Mentoring provides the mentee with an opportunity to think about career options and progress. A mentor asks questions, challenges assumptions while providing guidance and encouragement thereby strengthening the confidence of the mentee.
