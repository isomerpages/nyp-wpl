**Workplace Learning is more effective than learning outside of work.**

In the manpower-lean environment that most businesses operate in today, making full use of learning opportunities at work has become a business imperative in order to minimise downtime in operations.

Enterprises committed to supporting and developing their staff to grow into the job, excel on-the-job, and move across or up the organisation ladder will be more successful at retaining talent. This is especially critical for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), as they face more challenges in terms of recruitment, training and retention.

**Coaching is part of a supevisorâ€™s toolkit to develop skills and behaviours in staff.** 

The goal of coaching is to improve staff performance. A manager, supervisor or team lead can be a coach. Coaching can occur when an appropriate coachable moment arises.  A coaching session takes place as a conversation between the coach and the coachee. Instructing and demonstrating a skill or behavior is not enough. 

A coach asks questions and focuses on guiding the coachee to discover answers for themselves. Staff have more ownership with solutions that they have come up, rather than those that are forced upon them!



### Mentoring

**Mentoring is a powerful career development and engagement tool.**

It is an effective way of helping people to progress in their careers. It is a collaborative relationship between two people (mentor and mentee) normally not in a supervisor-supervisee relationship. The relationship is based upon openness, mutual trust and respect. 

A mentor helps the mentee explore career issues and guides them to take self-ownership for career development. Mentoring provides the mentee with an opportunity to think about career options and progress. A mentor asks questions, challenges assumptions while providing guidance and encouragement thereby strengthening the confidence of the mentee.


TBC on where should this go to? Should we inform IAL?
