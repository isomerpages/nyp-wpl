### PHASE ONE OF WORKPLACE LEARNING
## My company lacks proper training documentation.

#### Possible Work Situations
* I have a new company and I do not have any SOPs in place for my operations. 
* I just hired a group of new employees and it takes time to train them, affecting the productivitiy of my operations.
* I have difficulties capturing the skills and knowledge from my matured employees, and my operations will be hindered if they leaves the company.
* I find it hard to retain my employees as they felt that I am not training them adequately.


#### Explaination
New staff typically need time to settle in and understand their job role and work tasks well before being able to perform at optimum levels. This is where workplace learning solutions such as a structured on-boarding OJT blueprint can help fast-track them towards optimum performance levels. 

When new staff are able to know their roles well and start contributing in meaningful ways to their teams, productivity is enhanced, and a staffâ€™s sense of belonging can strengthen leading to a good work environment.
